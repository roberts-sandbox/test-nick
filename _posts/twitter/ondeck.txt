// SIMPLE TWEETS


A website is not a precious artifact. It’s a tool. #realness

Welcome to the post-web-standards era. #iJustSaidThat

Variations in user behavior and strategy require new user flows to be tested and vetted.

Responsive grid systems, modular UI elements, platform detection and event tracking #dopeness

Make interchangeable shit.

A grid system is very helpful in developing a consistent layout #indeed

Define the layout globally #css

define each element in relation to what’s been defined globally #css #grid

Use modular interface elements #UI

Don’t design a website. Design a UI. 

Templates can be mixed, matched and re-arranged

Affect tactical change #makeithappen

The most crippling issue faced with those tasked to manage a website is an inability to make rapid changes.

Design modular components #UI

Components are the nuts and bolts of the interface #UI

Durable components fit nicely into the space provided for them 

100% width as default #yesplease

Design for action, not demographic.

Many times, discussions about *users* will circle back to demographics. #dontdoit

Demographic is not the only factor that should be considered. #UserAction

Different motivations and priorities result in different actions #UserAction

Optimize for *action profiles* instead of demographics #UserAction

“Looking for cat toys” is much different than "loves cats" #UserAction

An action-based profile is more directly related to a user’s actual needs.

Make sites responsive and adaptive #bestcomboever

Multiplicity of screens #noun

Basing the features of a particular layout on screen size is a pretty good idea #yup #sureis

Start with a single breakpoint #css #simple

If you’re below a certain screen size, stack everything.

Detect for platforms and devices #justdoit

Code adaptive logic in a modular way 

Tailor content to various platforms and devices 

Track events and test out ideas

Events are trackable actions #GoodData

Follow a consistent naming schema when setting up custom events #GoodData

Organize event information for analysis and comparisons #GoodData

Every design should include a discussion about what events will be tracked #GoodData

Measure success.

Collect data and insight from real users 

User tests fall into two categories: qualitative and quantitative #GoodData

Qualitative testing involves a small group of users #GoodData

Quantitative testing involves a statistically significant sample of users #GoodData

Set an objective #GoodData

Goals seem obvious but they're not #vaguebook

Most of the time we deal with complex plans to achieve a variety of goals. 

Goals usually compete with each other

Be super clear about what it is you’re trying to achieve #GoodData

Understand how to establish an objective #GoodData

Understand how progress is tracked #GoodData

Start off with a high level goal, then trickle down to specific event metrics #GoodData

While a goal is overarching, an objective is specific. 

If the goal is to get more customers, the objective is to increase daily users of the store site by 8% by Q2.

It may seem like a pain, but it's a good idea #gettingStronger

If you can’t break down a quantifiable goal at the beginning, you might want to question the whole thing. #GoodData

Establish the metric you will use to determine whether something succeeds or fails

Design tests

Good Data is Good Design

Develop multiple concurrent designs

Track the performance, and ultimately determine which designs yield the best results #GoodData

Use web-based tools to route a small percentage of users into test buckets

Alternate. Design. Iterations.

The performance of each design iteration is tracked and compared, which determines winners and losers.

Go overboard!

Test versions should be decently fleshed out, but keep in mind that they’re still just prototypes

What do you want the user to click? #thingyoushouldask

What does success look like? #thingyoushouldask

Is it an email? Is it a download? #thingyoushouldask

Is it a location you want the user to reach? #thingyoushouldask

How can you give the user queues to complete the target action? #thingyoushouldask

What different options can you run against each other? #thingyoushouldask

Different hypotheses might require different types of tests

Figure out what you want to learn.

A/B Splits are when you test one design against another, such as the same layout and different button color.

hone in on what works and what doesn’t

A multi-variate test puts together different combinations and lets you know which is the winning combination.

Multi-paged tests let you test funnel vs funnel

Organize your data

Streamline your event tracking plan

Use tools such as Google Analytics or @Optimizely

Never underestimate the power of a simple, well-organized spreadsheet

Map and track variations and the data that goes along with each one

Spreadsheets fucking rule #GoodData

Share the information with the team, especially the Data Science team #GoodData

A prototype is an event tracking machine. #GoodData

Make sure you have an established schema #GoodData

Tag information such as the category and label can be used to help catalog and archive multiple experiments

Build and run tests

WYSIWYG!

Use your own web servers to host your own design variations

Variations on a web server, Optimizely to facilitate the test, collect events with Google Analytics #combo

use Optimizely to route traffic from production to test buckets

Use Google Analytics to track and archive all clicks, visits, and conversions

Compare and factor in overlap or discrepancies

In a process that can be both complicated and fast-paced, a little redundancy can be a good thing #GoodData

As I mentioned before, well-organized spreadsheets effing rule.

While your test prototype may looked polished, its main purpose is not to be perfect, but to track events.

Build things in a way that is easy to spin off new versions and new variations

Modular grid systems and UI components are useful tools in designing prototypes for rapid iteration

Use variables on event tracking scripts #IfYouLikeAwesome

Avoid releasing to 100% of production, ever.

Collect data about what works and what doesn’t

When it comes time to building the final production version, blah blah blah...

Tell the truth #dontlie

Compare the redundant information to make sure everything is consistent

Make sure the data is organized coherently in a format that can be shared

Testing is risk management #GoodData

Too many variations #StatisticalPitfalls

Timing and duration of tests #StatisticalPitfalls

Scaling to production #StatisticalPitfalls

Test/production data mismatches #StatisticalPitfalls

It’s not an exact science #LiveData

Information collected in live data tests is directional

Live data tests are best thought of in terms of risk management

Rule it out.

Each live data test should be based on a clear objective

Live data tests will help you settle debates

It's not a *page*

Dedicated, separate mobile websites are a thing of the past.

Devices interpret layouts in different ways, depending on the context in which the information is viewed

Different outputs on different devices with the same code? Yup.

Designs should melt into a whatever format is best for the device on which they are viewed. 

A moldable cluster of information

Get jiggy, but not too jiggy...

Set up breakpoints to correspond to the screen sizes of the most popular devices

The trick with responsive design is to keep it simple.

1 or 2 breakpoints, tops

Just pick one break point and go with it. #noyoudidnt

If you’re above this threshold, show the whole layout, otherwise stack everything. #keepitsimplefolks

A brand is not a logo, a visual style guide, a color palette, or a set of icons. #noshit

A solid brand experience is achieved using a set of messages that exist in time and space. 

Effective brand execution involves the efforts of product, user-experience, engineering and marketing.

Establish a #BrandSpace that contains consistent visual and verbal content

Each web property, UI element, image, copy line, tweet, notification, advertisement, business card is an opportunity for consistent messaging.

Tailor designs to a particular audience (or better yet, action profile) #UserAction

Successful brand execution involves elements that exist in the right place at the right time

A brand is greater than the sum of it’s parts

Gestalt much?

Identifiers: logos, icons marks, names. Think of these as equivalent to proper nouns. #BrandElements

Language: visual/verbal tone, editorial style, color and type palettes, layout and visual design, etc. #BrandElements

Relevant information: call to action hierarchy, product information, company information, up-to-date information. items that pull, instead of push. #BrandElements

Promotional: product marketing, suggestions, offers, calendar-related content, items that push. #BrandElements

A time and a place #GoodBrand

Time is the primary factor in determining the relevance of information or messaging. #GoodBrand

Create a message that is on-brand, and most importantly, on-point.

Stories unfold via elements that each have a specific shelf life

The logo of a company should hold it’s structure and relevance over time

Timely, calendar-driven, promotional content can take the form of the latest visual and verbal trends #GoodBrand

The devil is in the details #GoodBrand

Granular items such as notifications or error messages represent an opportunity for the personality of a brand to shine #GoodBrand

Map out verbal messaging the same way you map out visual design and promotional initiatives. #GoodBrand

Keep it real #GoodBrand

Messages are affected by time and space #GoodBrand

The shelf life of each item is useful in understanding how elements work together #GoodBrand

Shelf Life #GoodBrand

User-driven technology feels good and fits right #TheStitchExperience

Experiences are tailored for each user #TheStitchExperience

Hooks are encouraged and essential #TheStitchExperience

Good design is well-structured, crisp and effective #TheStitchExperience

Modularity is everything #TheStitchExperience

Connections are everywhere #TheStitchExperience

Durability is stylish #TheStitchExperience
