// SIMPLE TWEETS


Hone in on what works and what doesn’t

A multi-variate test puts together different combinations and lets you know which is the winning combination.

Multi-paged tests let you test funnel vs funnel

Organize your data

Streamline your event tracking plan

Use tools such as Google Analytics or @Optimizely

Never underestimate the power of a simple, well-organized spreadsheet

Map and track variations and the data that goes along with each one

Spreadsheets fucking rule #GoodData

Share the information with the team, especially the Data Science team #GoodData

A prototype is an event tracking machine. #GoodData

Make sure you have an established schema #GoodData

Tag information such as the category and label can be used to help catalog and archive multiple experiments

Build and run tests

WYSIWYG!

Use your own web servers to host your own design variations

Variations on a web server, Optimizely to facilitate the test, collect events with Google Analytics #combo

use Optimizely to route traffic from production to test buckets

Use Google Analytics to track and archive all clicks, visits, and conversions

Compare and factor in overlap or discrepancies

In a process that can be both complicated and fast-paced, a little redundancy can be a good thing #GoodData

As I mentioned before, well-organized spreadsheets effing rule.

While your test prototype may looked polished, its main purpose is not to be perfect, but to track events.

Build things in a way that is easy to spin off new versions and new variations

Modular grid systems and UI components are useful tools in designing prototypes for rapid iteration

Use variables on event tracking scripts #IfYouLikeAwesome

Avoid releasing to 100% of production, ever.

Collect data about what works and what doesn’t

When it comes time to building the final production version, blah blah blah...

Tell the truth #dontlie

Compare the redundant information to make sure everything is consistent

Make sure the data is organized coherently in a format that can be shared

Testing is risk management #GoodData

Too many variations #StatisticalPitfalls

Timing and duration of tests #StatisticalPitfalls

Scaling to production #StatisticalPitfalls

Test/production data mismatches #StatisticalPitfalls

It’s not an exact science #LiveData

Information collected in live data tests is directional

Live data tests are best thought of in terms of risk management

Rule it out.

Each live data test should be based on a clear objective

Live data tests will help you settle debates

It's not a *page*

Dedicated, separate mobile websites are a thing of the past.

Devices interpret layouts in different ways, depending on the context in which the information is viewed

Different outputs on different devices with the same code? Yup.

Designs should melt into a whatever format is best for the device on which they are viewed. 

A moldable cluster of information

Get jiggy, but not too jiggy...

Set up breakpoints to correspond to the screen sizes of the most popular devices

The trick with responsive design is to keep it simple.

1 or 2 breakpoints, tops

Just pick one break point and go with it. #noyoudidnt

If you’re above this threshold, show the whole layout, otherwise stack everything. #keepitsimplefolks

A brand is not a logo, a visual style guide, a color palette, or a set of icons. #noshit

A solid brand experience is achieved using a set of messages that exist in time and space. 

Effective brand execution involves the efforts of product, user-experience, engineering and marketing.

Establish a #BrandSpace that contains consistent visual and verbal content

Each web property, UI element, image, copy line, tweet, notification, advertisement, business card is an opportunity for consistent messaging.

Tailor designs to a particular audience (or better yet, action profile) #UserAction

Successful brand execution involves elements that exist in the right place at the right time

A brand is greater than the sum of it’s parts

Gestalt much?

Identifiers: logos, icons marks, names. Think of these as equivalent to proper nouns. #BrandElements

Language: visual/verbal tone, editorial style, color and type palettes, layout and visual design, etc. #BrandElements

Relevant information: call to action hierarchy, product information, company information, up-to-date information. items that pull, instead of push. #BrandElements

Promotional: product marketing, suggestions, offers, calendar-related content, items that push. #BrandElements

A time and a place #GoodBrand

Time is the primary factor in determining the relevance of information or messaging. #GoodBrand

Create a message that is on-brand, and most importantly, on-point.

Stories unfold via elements that each have a specific shelf life

The logo of a company should hold it’s structure and relevance over time

Timely, calendar-driven, promotional content can take the form of the latest visual and verbal trends #GoodBrand

The devil is in the details #GoodBrand

Granular items such as notifications or error messages represent an opportunity for the personality of a brand to shine #GoodBrand

Map out verbal messaging the same way you map out visual design and promotional initiatives. #GoodBrand

Keep it real #GoodBrand

Messages are affected by time and space #GoodBrand

The shelf life of each item is useful in understanding how elements work together #GoodBrand

Shelf Life #GoodBrand

User-driven technology feels good and fits right #TheStitchExperience

Experiences are tailored for each user #TheStitchExperience

Hooks are encouraged and essential #TheStitchExperience

Good design is well-structured, crisp and effective #TheStitchExperience

Modularity is everything #TheStitchExperience

Connections are everywhere #TheStitchExperience
