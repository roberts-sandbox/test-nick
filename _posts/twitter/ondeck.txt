// SIMPLE TWEETS

Compare and factor in overlap or discrepancies

Collect redundant data

Data science is risk management

Data synthesis is an educated guessing game.

In a process that can be both complicated and fast-paced, a little redundancy can be a good thing #GoodData

As I mentioned before, well-organized spreadsheets effing rule.

Did I mention how much I love spreadsheets?

I got mad spreadsheets, bro.

This is the internet.

Is this the best the internet can do?

Wait, but where is the internet?

While your test prototype may look polished, its main purpose is not to be perfect, but to track events.

The prototype is only there to provide data.

Don't worry about users who get caught in your test bucket. They will get over it.

Sometimes in order to improve user experience, you must first destroy it.

Build things in a way that is easy to spin off new versions and new variations

Favor workflows that allow you to create and deploy new variations

Don't host alternate designs on production servers

Add "Content Areas" to your list of UI staples

Develop "component sets"

Modular grid systems and UI components are useful tools in designing prototypes for rapid iteration

Use variables on event tracking scripts #IfYouLikeAwesome

Avoid releasing to 100% of production, ever.

Set up a subdomain that always has new, weird versions of your site/product

Divert traffic to a "canary server"

Collect data about what works and what doesn’t

Live data tests are a risk management best practice

When it comes time to building the final production version, blah blah blah...

Tell the truth #dontlie

Tell the truth #GoodData

Collect as much data as you can

Compare the redundant information to make sure everything is consistent

Make sure the data is organized coherently in a format that can be shared

Testing is risk management #GoodData

Too many variations #StatisticalPitfalls

Timing and duration of tests #StatisticalPitfalls

Scaling to production #StatisticalPitfalls

Test/production data mismatches #StatisticalPitfalls

It’s not an exact science #LiveData

Information collected in live data tests is directional

Live data tests are best thought of in terms of risk management

Rule it out.

Each live data test should be based on a clear objective

Live data tests will help you settle debates

Set up breakpoints to correspond to the screen sizes of the most popular devices

The trick with responsive design is to keep it simple.

1 or 2 breakpoints, tops

Just pick one break point and go with it. #noyoudidnt

If you’re above this threshold, show the whole layout, otherwise stack everything. #keepitsimplefolks

A brand is not a logo, a visual style guide, a color palette, or a set of icons. #noshit

A solid brand experience is achieved using a set of messages that exist in time and space. 

Effective brand execution involves the efforts of product, user-experience, engineering and marketing.

Establish a #BrandSpace that contains consistent visual and verbal content

Each web property, UI element, image, copy line, tweet, notification, advertisement, business card is an opportunity for consistent messaging.

Tailor designs to a particular audience (or better yet, action profile) #UserAction

Successful brand execution involves elements that exist in the right place at the right time

A brand is greater than the sum of it’s parts

Gestalt much?

Identifiers: logos, icons marks, names. Think of these as equivalent to proper nouns. #GoodBrand

Language: visual/verbal tone, editorial style, color and type palettes, layout and visual design, etc. #GoodBrand

Relevant information: call to action hierarchy, product information, company information, up-to-date information. items that pull, instead of push. #GoodBrand

Promotional: product marketing, suggestions, offers, calendar-related content, items that push. #GoodBrand

Time is the primary factor in determining the relevance of information or messaging. #GoodBrand

Create a message that is on-brand, and most importantly, on-point.

Stories unfold via elements that each have a specific shelf life

The logo of a company should hold it’s structure and relevance over time

Timely, calendar-driven, promotional content can take the form of the latest visual and verbal trends #GoodBrand

The devil is in the details #GoodBrand

Granular items such as notifications or error messages represent an opportunity for the personality of a brand to shine #GoodBrand

In the year, 2020, I will travel back in time to the year 1957 with a drum machine and record this album. I will store the record in a safe place, travel back to the present, locate the record, transcode it, and re-release it right now.
