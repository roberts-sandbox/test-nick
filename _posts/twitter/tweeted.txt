// TWEETS THAT HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED


A website is not a precious artifact. It’s a tool. #realness

Welcome to the post-web-standards era. #iJustSaidThat

Listen to this Nivana cover I did #MM

This is a rap song about the Matrix that me and my friend made. #MM http://ow.ly/nbzzr

Here's a link to my sort of Podcast: https://soundcloud.com/nickcottrell

Make interchangeable shit.

A grid system is very helpful in developing a consistent layout #indeed


Variations in user behavior and strategy require new user flows to be tested and vetted.


Responsive grid systems, modular UI elements, platform detection and event tracking #dopeness

Please think with me.

Listen Up! Here's how you can "do social media" better: https://soundcloud.com/nickcottrell/the-social-funnel

Listen to 5 easy steps to improving your social media strategies: https://soundcloud.com/nickcottrell/the-social-funnel

Define the layout globally #css

Use modular interface elements #UI

Don’t design a website. Design a UI. 

Templates can be mixed, matched and re-arranged

Affect tactical change #makeithappen

The most crippling issue faced with those tasked to manage a website is an inability to make rapid changes.

Components are the nuts and bolts of the interface #UI

Durable components fit nicely into the space provided for them 

100% width as default #yesplease

Design for action, not demographic.

Many times, discussions about *users* will circle back to demographics. #dontdoit

Awesome sites have awesome writing.
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/time-and-space/

Different motivations and priorities result in different actions #UserAction

Optimize for *action profiles* instead of demographics #UserAction

“Looking for cat toys” is much different than "loves cats" #UserAction

An action-based profile is more directly related to a user’s actual needs.

Make sites responsive and adaptive #bestcomboever

Multiplicity of screens #noun

Basing the features of a particular layout on screen size is a pretty good idea #yup #sureis

This just in: Rad metaphors are fucking awesome!
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/what-is-istitch/

Ah... the smell of ink on paper.
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/what-i-learned-from-print/

Start with a single breakpoint #css #simple

If you’re below a certain screen size, stack everything.

Detect for platforms and devices #justdoit

Code adaptive logic in a modular way 

Tailor content to various platforms and devices

Track events and test out ideas

Events are trackable actions #GoodData

Follow a consistent naming schema when setting up custom events #GoodData

Every design should include a discussion about what events will be tracked #GoodData

Measure success.

Collect data and insight from real users 

User tests fall into two categories: qualitative and quantitative #GoodData

Qualitative testing involves a small group of users #GoodData

Quantitative testing involves a statistically significant sample of users #GoodData

Set an objective #GoodData

Hi, look at me SCSS grid system:
https://github.com/nickcottrell/lining-for-layout

Every piece of text is an opportunity to connect with users.
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/time-and-space/

Goals seem obvious but they're not #vaguebook

Most of the time we deal with complex plans to achieve a variety of goals. 

Goals usually compete with each other


WE ARE NOT ZOMBIES!
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/save-it-for-the-cloud/



Be super clear about what it is you’re trying to achieve #GoodData

Understand how to establish an objective #GoodData

Start off with a high level goal, then trickle down to specific event metrics #GoodData

If the goal is to get more customers, the objective is to increase daily users of the store site by 8% by Q2.

It may seem like a pain, but it's a good idea #gettingStronger

User Testing: The Quant Years
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/how-to-run-live-data-tests/

Listen to my podcast about designing modern websites:
https://soundcloud.com/nickcottrell/built-for-change

Deliver messages that are awesome.
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/time-and-space/

If you can’t break down a quantifiable goal at the beginning, you might want to question the whole thing. #GoodData

Establish the metric you will use to determine whether something succeeds or fails

Design tests

Good Data is Good Design

Develop multiple concurrent designs

Track the performance, and ultimately determine which designs yield the best results #GoodData

Use web-based tools to route a small percentage of users into test buckets

Alternate. Design. Iterations.

The performance of each design iteration is tracked and compared, which determines winners and losers.

Check out this old school song I recorded in 2003. #StillRocks

Go overboard!

Test versions should be decently fleshed out, but keep in mind that they’re still just prototypes

What do you want the user to click? #thingyoushouldask

What does success look like? #thingyoushouldask

Is it an email? Is it a download? #thingyoushouldask

Is it a location you want the user to reach? #thingyoushouldask

How can you give the user queues to complete the target action? #thingyoushouldask

What different options can you run against each other? #thingyoushouldask

Different hypotheses might require different types of tests

A/B Splits are when you test one design against another, such as the same layout and different button color.

Apparently, I have a lot of ideas:
