// TWEETS THAT HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED


A website is not a precious artifact. It’s a tool. #realness

Welcome to the post-web-standards era. #iJustSaidThat

Listen to this Nivana cover I did #MM 
https://soundcloud.com/waytoosick/in-bloom-ncbs-epic-folk-tech

This is a rap song about the Matrix that me and my friend made. #MM http://ow.ly/nbzzr

Here's a link to my sort of Podcast: https://soundcloud.com/nickcottrell

Make interchangeable shit.

A grid system is very helpful in developing a consistent layout #indeed


Variations in user behavior and strategy require new user flows to be tested and vetted.


Responsive grid systems, modular UI elements, platform detection and event tracking #dopeness

Please think with me.

Listen Up! Here's how you can "do social media" better: https://soundcloud.com/nickcottrell/the-social-funnel

Listen to 5 easy steps to improving your social media strategies: https://soundcloud.com/nickcottrell/the-social-funnel

Define the layout globally #css

Use modular interface elements #UI

Don’t design a website. Design a UI. 

Templates can be mixed, matched and re-arranged

Affect tactical change #makeithappen

The most crippling issue faced with those tasked to manage a website is an inability to make rapid changes.

Components are the nuts and bolts of the interface #UI

Durable components fit nicely into the space provided for them 

100% width as default #yesplease

Design for action, not demographic.

Many times, discussions about *users* will circle back to demographics. #dontdoit

Awesome sites have awesome writing.
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/time-and-space/

Different motivations and priorities result in different actions #UserAction

Optimize for *action profiles* instead of demographics #UserAction

“Looking for cat toys” is much different than "loves cats" #UserAction

An action-based profile is more directly related to a user’s actual needs.

Listen to 5 ways you can build a modern website:
https://soundcloud.com/nickcottrell/built-for-change

Make sites responsive and adaptive #bestcomboever

Multiplicity of screens #noun

Basing the features of a particular layout on screen size is a pretty good idea #yup #sureis

This just in: Rad metaphors are fucking awesome!
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/what-is-istitch/

Ah... the smell of ink on paper.
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/what-i-learned-from-print/

Start with a single breakpoint #css #simple

If you’re below a certain screen size, stack everything.

Detect for platforms and devices #justdoit

Code adaptive logic in a modular way 

Tailor content to various platforms and devices

Track events and test out ideas

Events are trackable actions #GoodData

Follow a consistent naming schema when setting up custom events #GoodData

Every design should include a discussion about what events will be tracked #GoodData

Measure success.

Collect data and insight from real users 

User tests fall into two categories: qualitative and quantitative #GoodData

Qualitative testing involves a small group of users #GoodData

Quantitative testing involves a statistically significant sample of users #GoodData

Set an objective #GoodData

Hi, look at me SCSS grid system:
https://github.com/nickcottrell/lining-for-layout

Every piece of text is an opportunity to connect with users.
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/time-and-space/

Goals seem obvious but they're not #vaguebook

Most of the time we deal with complex plans to achieve a variety of goals. 

Goals usually compete with each other


WE ARE NOT ZOMBIES!
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/save-it-for-the-cloud/



Be super clear about what it is you’re trying to achieve #GoodData

Understand how to establish an objective #GoodData

Start off with a high level goal, then trickle down to specific event metrics #GoodData

If the goal is to get more customers, the objective is to increase daily users of the store site by 8% by Q2.

It may seem like a pain, but it's a good idea #gettingStronger

User Testing: The Quant Years
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/how-to-run-live-data-tests/

Listen to my podcast about designing modern websites:
https://soundcloud.com/nickcottrell/built-for-change

Deliver messages that are awesome.
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/time-and-space/

If you can’t break down a quantifiable goal at the beginning, you might want to question the whole thing. #GoodData

Establish the metric you will use to determine whether something succeeds or fails

Design tests

Good Data is Good Design

Develop multiple concurrent designs

Track the performance, and ultimately determine which designs yield the best results #GoodData

Use web-based tools to route a small percentage of users into test buckets

Alternate. Design. Iterations.

The performance of each design iteration is tracked and compared, which determines winners and losers.

Check out this old school song I recorded in 2003. #StillRocks
https://soundcloud.com/waytoosick/02-means-to-an-end

Go overboard!

Test versions should be decently fleshed out, but keep in mind that they’re still just prototypes

What do you want the user to click? #thingyoushouldask

What does success look like? #thingyoushouldask

Is it an email? Is it a download? #thingyoushouldask

Is it a location you want the user to reach? #thingyoushouldask

How can you give the user queues to complete the target action? #thingyoushouldask

What different options can you run against each other? #thingyoushouldask

Different hypotheses might require different types of tests

A/B Splits are when you test one design against another, such as the same layout and different button color.

Apparently, I have a lot of ideas:
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/

Um, the internet? https://soundcloud.com/nickcottrell/save-it-for-the-cloud

Um, the internet.

User-driven technology feels good and fits right #TheStitchExperience

Experiences are tailored for each user #TheStitchExperience

Hooks are encouraged and essential #TheStitchExperience

Good design is well-structured, crisp and effective #TheStitchExperience

Modularity is everything #TheStitchExperience

Connections are everywhere #TheStitchExperience

Durability is stylish #TheStitchExperience

Hone in on what works and what doesn’t

A multi-variate test puts together different combinations and lets you know which is the winning combination.

Multi-paged tests let you test funnel vs funnel

Organize your data

Streamline your event tracking plan

Manage a closed source project like it's an open source project.

WYSIWYG!

Use your own web servers to host your own design variations

Build and run tests

Testing? 1... 2... 3?
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/how-to-run-live-data-tests/

Spreadsheets fucking rule #GoodData

Share the information with the team, especially the Data Science team #GoodData

A prototype is an event tracking machine. #GoodData

Testing is a good idea. #umkay
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/how-to-run-live-data-tests/

Never underestimate the power of a simple, well-organized spreadsheet #GoodData

Map and track variations and the data that goes along with each one #GoodData

Breakpoints? I got breakpoints...
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/its-not-a-page/

Different outputs on different devices with the same code? Yup.

Devices interpret layouts in different ways, depending on the context in which the information is viewed


You got more breakpoints than bootstrap! #ahsnap
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/its-not-a-page/

How many breakpoints we talkin' bout here?
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/its-not-a-page/

It's not a *page*

Dedicated, separate mobile websites are a thing of the past.

Designs should melt into a whatever format is best for the device on which they are viewed. 

So how should I respond?
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/its-not-a-page/

A single breakpoint?? Are you fucking crazy?????
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/its-not-a-page/


Tag information such as the category and label can be used to help catalog and archive multiple experiments


Variations on a web server, Optimizely to facilitate the test, collect events with Google Analytics #combo

use Optimizely to route traffic from production to test buckets

Map out verbal messaging the same way you map out visual design and promotional initiatives. #GoodBrand

Keep it real #GoodBrand

Messages are affected by time and space #GoodBrand

The shelf life of each item is useful in understanding how elements work together #GoodBrand

Shelf Life #GoodBrand

A time and a place #GoodBrand

Compare and factor in overlap or discrepancies

Collect redundant data

Data science is risk management

In a process that can be both complicated and fast-paced, a little redundancy can be a good thing #GoodData

Did I mention how much I love spreadsheets?

This is the internet.

The Invisible Test Buckets #UXbandnames

Sometimes in order to improve user experience, you must first destroy it.

Modular grid systems and UI components are useful tools in designing prototypes for rapid iteration

Tailor designs to a particular audience (or better yet, action profile) #UserAction

Gestalt much?

Make your website dope as fuc.
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/how-to-make-a-modern-website/

I got mad spreadsheets, bro.

Urban design is a thing:
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/what-i-learned-from-urban-design/


Stories unfold via elements that each have a specific shelf life

Language: visual/verbal tone, editorial style, color and type palettes, layout and visual design, etc. #GoodBrand

Rule it out.

Even if you can't share it with the world...
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/intra-source/

Identifiers: logos, icons marks, names. Think of these as equivalent to proper nouns. #GoodBrand

Time is the primary factor in determining the relevance of information or messaging. #GoodBrand

A brand is not a logo, a visual style guide, a color palette, or a set of icons. #noshit

So... how's it going? blah blah blah #fartnoise

Thank God for all these benevolent corporations who graciously allow us to use their internet.

The internet is like a bunch of interconnected shopping malls. #NotPublic

Tell the truth #dontlie

Don't worry about users who get caught in your test bucket. They will get over it.

Collect data about what works and what doesn’t

Instead of reading Fifty Shades of Gray, you should just read the reviews on Amazon #better

MY EMOJIS DON'T WORK! - said a 12 year old, and me

The internet is feudalistic at best.

Things like notifications or error messages represent an opportunity for the personality of a brand to shine

Information collected in live data tests is directional

Live data tests are best thought of in terms of risk management

The trick with responsive design is to keep it simple.

The US Constitution #goodread

Jane Jacobs on Good Gentrification:
http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/04/getting-jane-jacobs-right/38391/

The internet is not a public place.

Establish a #BrandSpace that contains consistent visual and verbal content

The logo of a company should hold it’s structure and relevance over time

1 or 2 breakpoints, tops

Set up breakpoints to correspond to the screen sizes of the most popular devices

There is unfortunately no public space on the internet.

Too many variations #StatisticalPitfalls

Timing and duration of tests #StatisticalPitfalls

Scaling to production #StatisticalPitfalls

Test/production data mismatches #StatisticalPitfalls

Collect as much data as you can

Data empowers.

Neo-feudalism is happening already--on the internetz. lolz........

Please. Read my effing blog:

As soon as this bay bridge thing is done I'm gonna drive from Berkeley to SF to Pacifica to HMB and pass through that new tunnel

Prototypes only exist to provide data.

As I mentioned before, spreadsheets effing rule.

Use variables on event tracking scripts #IfYouLikeAwesome

Avoid releasing to 100% of production, ever.

When it comes time to building the final production version, blah blah blah...

Tell the truth #GoodData

Just pick one break point and go with it. #noyoudidnt

Experience is achieved through a set of messages that exist in time and space.

Successful brand execution involves elements that exist in the right place at the right time

Organize your ideas in a format that can be shared

So, tell me about this *responsive* design thing...
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/its-not-a-page/

Yah, so I pretty much love jekyll.
https://github.com/nickcottrell/nickcottrell.github.com

Each web property, UI element, image, copy line, tweet, notification, advertisement, business card is an opportunity for consistent messaging.

Each live data test should be based on a clear objective

It’s not an exact science #LiveData

Live data tests are a risk management best practice

Add "Content Areas" to your list of UI staples

I bet you #Twerking is no longer trending.

I got mad spreadsheets, bro.

Is this the best the internet can do?

The internet is not free.

Listen to a few tips on how to manage your walled garden:

http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/the-social-funnel/

Time and Space
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/time-and-space/

Build things in a way that is easy to spin off new versions and new variations

While your prototype may look polished, its main purpose is not to be perfect, but to track events.

Favor workflows that allow you to create and deploy new variations

Don't host alternate options designs on production servers

Set up a subdomain that always has new, weird versions of your site/product

Divert traffic to a "canary server"

Compare the redundant information to make sure everything is consistent

Testing is risk management #GoodData

Relevant information: call to action hierarchy, product information, company information, up-to-date information. items that pull, instead of push. #GoodBrand

Timely, calendar-driven, promotional content can take the form of the latest visual and verbal trends #GoodBrand

If you’re above this threshold, show the whole layout, otherwise stack everything. #keepitsimplefolks

Effective brand execution involves the efforts of product, user-experience, engineering and marketing.

Data is an educated guessing game.

Wait, but where *is* the internet?

Make sure it's shiny! ...and extra modern!
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/how-to-make-a-modern-website/

What the eff is a "modern website" anyway?
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/how-to-make-a-modern-website/

Urban design is similar to tech but much slower. #bummer
http://nickcottrell.info/ideas/what-i-learned-from-urban-design/

Promotional: product marketing, suggestions, offers, calendar-related content, items that push. #GoodBrand
