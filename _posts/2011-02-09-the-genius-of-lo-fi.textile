<h2>Lo-fi, garage, folk-tech–whatever. There’s an interesting brand of music that’s saturating scene.</h2>

While the mainstream pathetically spits out hi-gloss, overly compressed rubish (see loudness wars), it seems as though the forces of balance are inevitebly at play. Similar to the early ‘grunge’ movement of the early 90′s, the lo-fi movement attempts to force a cultural correction of sorts. It’s real. It’s raw. It has texture and context.
