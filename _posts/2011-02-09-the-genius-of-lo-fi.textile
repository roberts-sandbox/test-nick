While the mainstream pathetically spits out hi-gloss, overly compressed rubbish (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gmex_4hreQ">loudness wars</a>), it seems as though the forces of balance are inevitably at play. Similar to the early ‘grunge’ movement of the early 90′s, the lo-fi movement attempts to force a cultural correction of sorts. It’s real. It’s raw. It has texture and context.
