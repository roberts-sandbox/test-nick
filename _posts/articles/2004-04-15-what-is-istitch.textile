<h2>So what's with the "stitch" theme? It's something I've been playing around with for years. The concept has proven to be reasonable and durable. Welcome to the manifesto.</h2>

The basic idea is that design and technology are similar to the craft of tailoring. At the root, much of it has do with stitching things together--finding connections and linking things. Even more so, in the pragmatic field of user experience engineering, there is a lot of hookery and hackery involved as things actually get done, when links and connections become reality. 

The term "stitching" something together can apply to a variety of tasks such as the application of a JavaScript hack to a web interface, fitting a new feature into an existing product, or managing an event tracking schema on a funnel that spans across multiple infrastructural components. Coming from a classic industry, it also provides a plethora of terms and vocabulary words to nerd out on when <a href="/code-samples/">naming projects</a> and coming up with <a href="http://twitter.com/istitch">twitter handles.</a> "<a href='http://twitter.com/istitch'>I stitch</a>, therefore..."

Stitch represents the pragmatic process of design for usable, durable, interwoven systems. 

<h3>A Few Principals</h3>

* User-driven technology feels good and fits right
* Experiences are tailored for each user
* Hooks are encouraged and essential
* Good design is well-structured, crisp and effective
* Modularity is everything
* Connections are everywhere
* Durability is stylish

Currently, I'm the Web UX Lead at BitTorrent, Inc. It's a lot of interesting projects for a brand that scales to over 100 million. We were recently featured as one of Fast Company's "50 Most Innovative" Companies. Check out the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2013/bittorrent">profile</a>.
