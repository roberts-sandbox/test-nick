<h2>So what's this "stitch" thing all about? It's a theme I've been playing around with for years related to user interface. It's about bringing elements together to create practical user experiences&mdash;leveraging the things that work and scrapping the things that don't. Design should be reasonable and durable. Welcome to the manifesto.</h2>

Design and technology are similar to the craft of tailoring. At the root, much of it has do with stitching things together--finding connections and linking things. Even more so, in the pragmatic field of user experience engineering, there is a lot of hookery and hackery involved as things actually get done, when links and connections become reality. 

The term "stitching" something together can apply to a variety of tasks such as the application of a JavaScript hack to a web interface, fitting a new feature into an existing product, or managing an event tracking schema on a funnel that spans across multiple infrastructural components. Comparing modern interface design to a classical industry also provides a plethora of terms and vocabulary words to nerd out on when <a href="/code-samples/">naming projects</a> and coming up with <a href="http://twitter.com/istitch">twitter handles.</a> "<a href='http://twitter.com/istitch'>I stitch</a>, therefore..."

Stitch represents the pragmatic process of design for usable, durable, interwoven systems.
