"making it" in design is hard
- before the days of social networking
- mailed letters to design firms
- went to AIGA events

AIGA provided a solid network
- 90% of all leads and opportunities came from AIGA
- Sense of community  
- Involvement provided experience

AIGA Y conference exposed me to the best designers
- sense of community
- more intimate than HOW or SXSW
- design theory
