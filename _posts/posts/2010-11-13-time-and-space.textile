<h2>A brand is not a logo, a visual style guide, a color palette, or a set of icons. A brand is a nebulous cloud that exists in time and space. It’s the set of feelings or impressions people have about an entity and its products or services. Therefore, it touches on everything that each department of that entity brings to the table.</h2>

In a product company, an effective brand execution strategy involves the coordinated effort of the product, user-experience, engineering and marketing teams. With a non-linear relationship, the combined effort of these departments touches on each aspect of the user-experience. The overarching goal is to establish a brandspace that contains consistent visual and verbal content, providing the experiencee with usable products and useful information at appropriate times.

<h3>Elements of the Brandspace</h3>

The following is a list of elements that provide impressions. Consistency is paramount. Each item, or user touchpoint, should reinforce one another and should help define, and exist inside of, the brandspace. Elements and identifiers provide a consistent space for changeable, timely content. The goal of the brandspace is to preserve the integrity of information, keeping it useful and relevant.

<ul>
	<li><strong>identifiers:</strong> logos, icons marks, names… think of these as equivalent to proper nouns.</li>
	<li><strong>language:</strong> visual/verbal tone, editorial style, color and type palettes, layout and graphic style, etc…. the flavor.</li>
	<li><strong>relevant information:</strong> product information, company information, up-to-date information. items that pull, instead of push…</li>
	<li><strong>promotional:</strong> product suggestions, new offers, calendar-related content, items that push….</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Brandspace Dynamic</h3>

A successful brand execution involves an ecosystem that exists in the brandspace. The stage is set with identifiers in the right place.  Useful, relevant information is provided with a consistent visual/verbal language. Timely content is displayed in an appropriate, non-distracting way. The user is able to navigate through the brandspace, obtaining useful information and products along the way.

Through this process, a story unfolds with elements that each have a unique lifespan. This is the basis for a cascade to occur in the brandspace.  The longer the lifespan of an element, the simpler the element should be. For example, the logo of a company should hold it’s structure and relevance over time, while timely, calendar-driven, promotional content can take the form of the latest visual/verbal trends.


Another layer of communication in the brandspace is the aspect of self-identity and reputation management. Woven into each message is a secondary message that always provides the user with an idea of who or what the entity is. Aside from an “about us” page on an entity’s website, the process is frequently subtle and subconscious. An additional element of this layer has to do with objective-based messaging–the element of the message that identifies what the entity is attempting to achieve. An example of this layer could be in the form of a tag line. The most successful jaunt by a user through a entity’s brandspace will involve them being able to intuitively determine who the branded entity is, and what they are doing.

If an entity can be aware of how messages are affected by time and space, they are in a much better position to create consistent messaging without having to re-invent the wheel by producing countless revisions to their brand experience. A well thought-out approach will provide a set of conventions that become scalable as new elements are added, removed and or products combined.
