	<h1><a href='/articles/2012/03/19/save-it-for-the-cloud'>Save the small talk for cloud</a></h1>
	<p class="post_date">March 19, 2012</p>	
	<h2>Now more than ever, devices are allowing people to link up in new ways. The common perception is that we are a disconnected generation, yet new technology is enabling us to keep up and stay connected with more people than ever before.</h2>
<div class="img_wrap"><img src="/img/articles/smalltalk-1024x574.png" width="100%" /></div><p><br /></p>
<p>The Interactive portion of South-By-Southwest (<span class="caps">SXSW</span>) has helped bring to light the notion that we&#8217;re creating a &#8220;disconnectedly connected&#8221; society. But if you have a conversation with the folks who are innovating new ways to communicate, you&#8217;ll understand that there exists a scheme to eventually connect us all, effortlessly and endlessly, to everything and anything (i.e. the &#8220;Mind Meld&#8221;). And we&#8217;re actually further along than you might think.</p>
<p>Contrary to what many people believe (roll the stock zombie footage), technology and social media are actually making us <em>better</em> socializers. How many times have you recently been in a conversation with an old friend that didn&#8217;t involve any small talk? Recently, I ran into someone who I follow on Twitter. The normal, small talk, catch-up nonsense didn&#8217;t happen. We just didn&#8217;t go there. We&#8217;d been keeping in touch the whole time and when we saw each other, it was easy to immediately drill down to a more in-depth subject such as a problem my friend was having with his misbehaving dog. (Yay, friends actually supporting each other&#8230;)</p>
<p>See, although I&#8217;ve been blessed with &#8220;the gift of gab,&#8221; I really dislike small talk. I&#8217;d much rather exchange a meaningful observation, engage in a healthy debate or help someone solve a problem. Tools like Facebook and Twitter actually make in-person situations more fluid, because they allow people to keep each other in the loop.</p>
<p>But what about <em>the real world</em>? New apps such as <a href="http://highlig.ht/index.html">Highlight</a> help bridge the gap between digital and physical community. Using smartphone location information, the app lets you know who&#8217;s around you and who, if any, your mutual friends are. As this type of thing becomes more ubiquitous, we&#8217;ll begin to get a better picture of who we&#8217;re connected with, at any given moment, in real space.</p>
<p>While it makes for a great narrative, the &#8220;disengaged generation&#8221;, walking around, unaware of their surroundings, is a myth. The true reality is that we are getting better and better at using devices to enhance our reality with context and information, previously unavailable. The rapid pace and specificity at which we communicate is helping us keep up with and connect to more people than ever before, in more meaningful ways. As for the small talk, save it for the cloud.</p>

	<h2>Different outputs on different devices with the same code? That’s the trend these days. No longer are we stuck to a particular view applied to many devices. Instead, devices interpret the layout in different ways depending on the context in which the information is viewed. Dedicated, separate mobile websites are a thing of the past. Buh-bye…</h2>
<div class="img_wrap"><img src="/img/articles/snap-1024x574.png" width="100%" /></div><p><br /></p>
<p><em>The <a href="http://nickcottrell.github.com/lab/templates/snap/">sample above</a> displays a style of website layout design that responds to the device by snapping into various views depending the device’s screen size, providing the user with a more seamless experience from mobile to desktop.</em></p>
<p>Good design is supposed to be flexible. You can’t force-fit a single design into a variety of formats. For too long, web design has been an extension of print design, hence antiquated terms we use every day such as ‘web page.’ At this point, the web is ready for a better design. Something that snaps into place depending on its context.</p>
<p>Until now, many designs started off with constrained proportions… with a designer laying out a page, as though it was going to be printed and cut to a particular size. For the web, that’s the wrong approach. Designs should be gooey forms that melt into whichever format they are viewed. They should be thought of as a moldable cluster of information, with variables and tolerances built to mesh with different formats and devices.</p>
<p>This layout is an example of such a form. <a href="http://nickcottrell.github.com/lab/templates/snap/">Snap!</a> is a template, designed to demonstrate how layouts can transform depending on the format, size and device type. Hopefully you can imagine how this type of layout can work its way into many different applications. Please take look. Re-size it. Stretch it. View the source. Kick the tires…</p>

	<h1><a href='/articles/2011/07/11/less-is-more'>Less is More</a></h1>
	<p class="post_date">July 11, 2011</p>	
	<h2>While many of the new features of Apple’s new Lion operating system (10.7) are a welcome addition, it seems like much was added and little taken away. I think we should expect more… or maybe actually less… from our friends in Cupertino.</h2>
<div class="img_wrap"><img src="/img/articles/new_groups_proposed_by_nickcottrell-1024x574.png" width="100%" /></div><p><br /></p>
<p><em>The photo above is a mock I made to show how the ‘grid’ view could be combined with the iOS-style “apps” grid configuration for a more streamlined solution.</em></p>
<p>Simplicity is what we come to expect from Apple, the company that has revolutionized consumer electronics with beautifully executed industrial design and streamlined user interfaces. Apple has taught us that good design not only kicks ass because it’s cool, it’s also <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-18/apple-profit-rises-78-on-holiday-ipad-iphone-mac-demand-shares-climb.html">extremely profitable</a>. The relentless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive">pursuit of perfection</a> is virtually unmatched, but the latest iteration of the <span class="caps">OSX</span> operating system might fall short on a couple of key features.</p>
<p>Masterful at the showmanship of public announcement, the rollout campaign for the new Lion operating system has been enough to <a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&sugexp=esqb%2Cratio%3D4%2Cdepth%3D20&cp=14&gs_id=91&xhr=t&q=os+X+lion+review&qe=b3MgWCBsaW9uIHJldmk&qesig=6Nd1IzbYd9FnjDWBvYljnQ&pkc=AFgZ2tl8CUCVP74D0Cv4KtwemSDP1a5738I7KlIfgSKIq-FNZUQvSypZC1SjeQJcqRS6BhuvzZPqbVrDtw7m-XHTBpBe1bPaUA&pf=p&sclient=psy&source=hp&pbx=1&oq=os+X+lion+revi&aq=0&aqi=g2g-m1g-b2&aql=f&gs_sm=&gs_upl=&fp=1&biw=1051&bih=736&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&cad=b">turn the heads</a> of fanboys and neigh-sayers alike. Promises of a new streamlined interface aimed at linking the wildly popular iOS and its family of devices to the desktop space, have definitely set a very high bar even higher. After previewing some of the features, it turns out the bar might be a little too high this time.</p>
<p><em>Note: these are just mocks! The feature does not actually exist in Lion! It’s just what I’m proposing!</em></p>
<p>A simple <a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&sugexp=esqb%2Cratio%3D4%2Cdepth%3D20&cp=14&gs_id=91&xhr=t&q=os+X+lion+review&qe=b3MgWCBsaW9uIHJldmk&qesig=6Nd1IzbYd9FnjDWBvYljnQ&pkc=AFgZ2tl8CUCVP74D0Cv4KtwemSDP1a5738I7KlIfgSKIq-FNZUQvSypZC1SjeQJcqRS6BhuvzZPqbVrDtw7m-XHTBpBe1bPaUA&pf=p&sclient=psy&source=hp&pbx=1&oq=os+X+lion+revi&aq=0&aqi=g2g-m1g-b2&aql=f&gs_sm=&gs_upl=&fp=1&biw=1051&bih=736&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&cad=b">google search</a> will be easy to find all the reviews–good or bad–of this widely popular product. However, I decided to focus on one particular feature and propose a solution. I’ve created a series of mock-ups that display some potential improvements to the “grid” view that, until I demo’ed the OS, I thought were going to be replaced by the iOS-style “apps” grid configuration.</p>
<p>The idea is to replace the standard “grid” view with the new iOS-style “apps” grid, which I believe is superior to its older counterpart. The new “apps” style grid, is more streamlined and has simple interaction behaviors that allow the user to organize and arrange items. It was the thing I was looking forward to the most in this latest version. Frankly, I was pretty disappointed when I previewed the <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Mac-OS-X-Lion-Preview-Launchpad-Mission-Control-162152.shtml">launchpad feature</a>, which gives the feature a minimal–or minimally integrated–place in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>As the primary form of navigation for iOS touch devices, it is virtually a sidebar feature in Lion. I almost have to think that there must have been some contentious debate about adding it to this release because it feels like simply an add-on (although that is complete speculation on my part). Maybe they want to see what sticks. Whatever. I still think it was a little half-assed.</p>
<p><em>Note: this are just mocks! The feature does not actually exist in Lion! It’s just what I’m proposing!</em></p>
<p>My proposal basically kills the old “grid” view from the OS and introduces “groups” to those views instead of folders. In my opinion, I think grouping items is a better way to organize and is the direction Apple has taken in other views such as the list view shown (above) in this post. My proposal would simply do away with the existing “grid” so that a more seemless integration can take place. Instead of simply tacking on the feature as a separate function completely, I propose to integrate the functionality into the OS.</p>
<p>Personally I think that the old “grid” view is outdated. For example when the grid expands from the “Applications” folder in the Dock, there’s no way to interact with and arrange the apps. Folder-style directories (another outdated archetype) are displayed with another pop-over menu, which is not nearly as elegant as the breakaway expanded “groups” view in the iOS grid style.</p>
<p>Basically, I’m going to, of course, get used to the new features like everyone else in the Mac universe. Hopefully, Apple is simply creating the space for further refinement to take place for the next iteration. My only problem is that, for all the hoopla, it seems like Apple is putting out a cookie that’s only half-baked. I’ve come to expect more (or most of the time, less) from Apple, and suspect that some of the issues that are popping up will be fleshed out at some point after the big, big release of iCloud this Fall. I just hope that Apple will concentrate on what it’s releasing to consumers now, instead of focusing more and more on the future roadmap.</p>
<p>Apple is best known for releasing products that are distilled to a simple, easy-to-use format. The latest Lion product has more added than reduced… just sayin.</p>

	<h1><a href='/articles/2011/06/27/utorrent-3-0-gets-a-new-ui'>µTorrent gets a makeover</a></h1>
	<p class="post_date">June 27, 2011</p>	
	<h2>The new µTorrent version 3.0 has been a long time in the making. In addition to streamlining the functional structure of the UI to provide more options to the user, careful attention was spent on adding an improved brand experience to the product, making it more consistent with the ecosystem from which it is discovered.</h2>
<div class="img_wrap"><img src="/img/articles/utorrent-gets-a-makeover-1024x574.png" width="100%" /></div><p><br /></p>
<h3>Color</h3>
<p>The first noticeable difference in the new product is the monochromatic approach. µTorrent green is dominant in the color palette, and allows the functional color palette to stand out, boldly highlighting status, and action-related functionality.</p>
<p>In addition to the color palette, there were also subtle changes to the treatment of the icons, such as a slight ‘deboss’ effect on the items that appear directly on the chrome of the toolbar vs. the slight shadow and 3-dimension to the status icons.</p>
<h3>Consistency</h3>
<p>A consistent, branded approach was taken in the UI as well as a re-vamped consumer facing acquisition funnel. By the time the user opens up the product for the first time, the website helps to create a familiarity with the product brand and the icons on the user-interface.</p>
<h3>Clarity</h3>
<p>Not only does the new 3.0 client look-and-feel more consistent in terms of the visual brand, it also contains features that make it easier to use for new users as well as the pros. One such crossover feature is the minified view. The new user will hopefully be less overwhelmed with all the information that’s in the detailed view, while the expert will hopefully find the view useful for simpler, ‘info-at-a-glance’ view.</p>
<p>There’s also a <a href="http://vimeo.com/25214653">new video</a> (produced by <a href="http://alchemycreative.tv/">Alchemy Creative</a>) featured directly in the client’s own ‘getting started’ page. The quality of animation preps the launch for prime time as well as provides super useful information to the new user.</p>
<p>With over 100M+ users in the BitTorrent ecosystem, there are bound to be many opinions about the new 3.0 µTorrent client. However, one thing is certain: many people worked toward the goal of making a product that is lightweight (still weighing in at only about 600K), efficient, and simple for the noob and expert alike!

	<h1><a href='/articles/2011/03/29/naked-social-media'>Naked Social Media</a></h1>
	<p class="post_date">March 29, 2011</p>	
	<h2>While companies like Facebook and Google actively try to enhance the social media space by adding more, a few of us are trying to figure out ways to simplify our on-line experience.</h2>
<div class="img_wrap"><img src="/img/articles/hello-world-1024x574.png" width="100%" /></div><p><br /></p>
<p>Recently, I made some changes to the structure of the the myriad personal profiles I (and all of us, now-a-days) have online. The idea was to remove some of the duplicate info that I would have on a personal website and focus energy on the what’s most important–keeping relevant information online and creating a workflow that effectively managing the sharing and cataloging of said information. The basic idea was to describing what I’ve done, where I’m at, what I’m doing, how I’m doing it, and sharing that information with as many people as possible.</p>
<p>The idea was to work the online presence, helping to curate what is on various profiles and to reduce the amount of duplicate info. Instead of duplicating the info, I set up pointers to various pieces of info. It seems obvious, but you’d be surprised at how much duplicate info you have out there. In some ways, I had to keep reminding myself that a link to somewhere else on the web is not a bad thing. For example, no more posted résumé PDF’s and things like that. Those sorts of items should be replaced with links to profiles such as linkedin.</p>
<p>I designed a social media hub page, which links all of my various media. Many people are starting to do this with sites such as <a href="https://about.me/">about.me</a> and <a href="http://onesheet.com/">onesheet.com</a>. I just wanted to make my own because that’s what I do!</p>
<p>Simplicity is also in the way things are named. Another key part of the strategy of simplification was to set up a set forwarding URLs that make logical sense and link to my various profiles. For example, the base <span class="caps">URL</span> is “nickcottrell.info” which makes sense because it’s info about me, nick cottrell. When I want to share my music on SoundCloud, I set up the <span class="caps">URL</span>, “<a href="http://soundcloud.com/waytoosick">nickcottrell.info/music</a>.” I set up a similar forwarding <span class="caps">URL</span> for each of my online profiles, e.g. linkedin, twitter, etc.</p>
<p>I also removed residual information that I had on my old website, istitch.net by using a public <a href="https://github.com/nickcottrell/istitch.net-complete-archive">GitHub repo</a> as an archive, set up referring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404">404′s</a> and funneled all traffic to the main site. It felt good to finally put the old site away and get that off of my server.</p>
<p>The idea was that by simplifying things, we can leverage social media more efficiently to better collaborate with each other. However, the challenge has been (and continues to be), the overarching anxiety all of these online profiles cause me personally as I try to navigate through it all. Weaving these things together in a logical way will hopefully help pave the way for the next generation of interconnected individuals.</p>

	<h2>Here’s a peak at one of my on-going projects. It’s a UI I’m designing to use for multi-device display. The goal is to develop a usable system that works for the web as well as tablets and mobiles. The general idea is along the lines of web design that feels more app-like and less like a “page.”</h2>
<div class="img_wrap"><img src="/img/articles/ui-1024x574.png" width="100%" /></div><p><br /></p>
<p>First step is to design it. Some of the behaviors are fantasies that I’m not quite sure how to build a la the ‘pullstretch’ menu. The idea is that it works like a window shade. The user pulls down on it to a certain point where it sticks and stays down. To return it back to it’s collapsed state, the user pulls on it further, which causes it to release and snap back into it’s original place. The function will work as a drag and drop feature on a desktop terminal and as a tap and slide feature on a touchscreen.</p>
<p>Perhaps I will eventually use an existing <span class="caps">MVC</span> and add a modular set of UI elements that can act as a sort of widget system. I’d like it to be customizable with straight forward code that doesn’t get too complicated like many of these Javascript frameworks that are coming out every week. The goal will be for it to be simple enough for me to produce, while flexible enough for it to apply to many different projects.</p>

	<h2>Lo-fi, garage, folk-tech–whatever. There’s an interesting brand of music that’s saturating scene.</h2>

<p>While the mainstream pathetically spits out hi-gloss, overly compressed rubbish (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gmex_4hreQ">loudness wars</a>), it seems as though the forces of balance are inevitably at play. Similar to the early ‘grunge’ movement of the early 90′s, the lo-fi movement attempts to force a cultural correction of sorts. It’s real. It’s raw. It has texture and context.</p>

	<h2>Most of the time we find ourselves fighting against the many distractions that steal our attention during the work day. What if you could use distraction as a method to increase creativity and productivity? I tried just that in an experiment to combine multiple projects in one design session.</h2>
<div class="img_wrap"><img src="/img/articles/juxtopposed-1024x574.png" width="100%" /></div><p><br /></p>
<p>I recently did an experiment on juxtaposition. It involved working simultaneously on multiple projects. At the time, I was doing UI work on a couple of different projects, while taking photos and writing this. I had my desktop, laptop and iPad set-up. The main project was on the desktop and the minor project on the laptop. Notes and blog, writing took place on the iPad.</p>
<p>The session went interestingly. The process allowed me to develop very specific items for one project while focusing more strategically on the other. Switching between the 2 allowed me to shift gears, in an efficient manner, so thought was devoted appropriately to each. (I remember seeing Art Chantry speak on the subject of ‘distraction as a method’ in which he claimed to work with the TV on as a way to keep his himself from focusing too much on a single task at hand.) It’s a double rev of sorts.</p>
<p>Setting up an efficient workspace/workflow ahead of time is key for the rest to take place. The key is to take a look at the projects you are working on and to think about the moving parts ahead of time. What directories will I be accessing? What is the file naming system I intend to use? Am I going to need to transfer files between machines? Which device should I use to access the internet? Where am I taking notes? Which project will require my creative expansive thinking? Which project will require my precision and technical skills? Will I be tweeting ideas as I’m working? Establishing some ground rules ahead of time is important.</p>
<p>For example, during the session, I made some tactical progress in the strategic process, by learning about and generating a custom jquery theme to start implementing on a website while I worked on a layered photoshop file for some polished UI elements. I also wrote the ‘lo-fi’ article on this blog while listening to some music.</p>
<p>Combined efforts turned out to be productive. I made progress on 2 projects, wrote 2 blog articles and felt good about the general direction on all. The process helped me maintain a liquid approach to all the ideas therein. What would have been considered a set of peripheral concepts turned out to help shape and hone, indirectly, informing and reflecting. It might not work for every situation, but sometimes working on items side-by-side, in a controlled environment, with an organized work-flow can help stimulate the creative process for each one and for the session as a whole.</p>
<p>The seamless UI and integrated systems that exist in today’s workspaces and software allow for an unprecedented workflow to occur. The idea is to set the stage for the creative project. Items must be put in place to establish a good workflow. A person must move efficiently through the space, building, transferring, documenting, sharing. As the level of workflow efficiency increases, systems can operate in the background, allowing for the zen of problem solving. Why waste time figuring out how to transfer a file between machines, or fiddle around with some application update when the flow is at its peak?</p>
<p>Lessons learned: Don’t waste time thinking about workflow during a creative session. Try to get that part out of the way ahead of time. Front-ending the time and energy to set up a good workflow will allow you to focus more on creativity, switching between projects to clear you mind from one as you approach the other. Sometimes, the only way to find focus is to distract yourself!</p>

	<p class="post_date">November 13, 2010</p>	
	<h2>A brand is not a logo, a visual style guide, a color palette, or a set of icons. A brand is a nebulous cloud that exists in time and space. It’s the set of feelings or impressions people have about an entity and its products or services. Therefore, it touches on everything that each department of that entity brings to the table.</h2>
<div class="img_wrap"><img src="/img/articles/brandspace-1024x574.png" width="100%" /></div><p><br /></p>
<p>In a product company, an effective brand execution strategy involves the coordinated effort of the product, user-experience, engineering and marketing teams. With a non-linear relationship, the combined effort of these departments touches on each aspect of the user-experience. The overarching goal is to establish a brandspace that contains consistent visual and verbal content, providing the experiencee with usable products and useful information at appropriate times.</p>
<h3>Elements of the Brandspace</h3>
<p>The following is a list of elements that provide impressions. Consistency is paramount. Each item, or user touchpoint, should reinforce one another and should help define, and exist inside of, the brandspace. Elements and identifiers provide a consistent space for changeable, timely content. The goal of the brandspace is to preserve the integrity of information, keeping it useful and relevant.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>identifiers:</strong> logos, icons marks, names… think of these as equivalent to proper nouns.</li>
	<li><strong>language:</strong> visual/verbal tone, editorial style, color and type palettes, layout and graphic style, etc…. the flavor.</li>
	<li><strong>relevant information:</strong> product information, company information, up-to-date information. items that pull, instead of push…</li>
	<li><strong>promotional:</strong> product suggestions, new offers, calendar-related content, items that push….</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Brandspace Dynamic</h3>
<p>A successful brand execution involves an ecosystem that exists in the brandspace. The stage is set with identifiers in the right place.  Useful, relevant information is provided with a consistent visual/verbal language. Timely content is displayed in an appropriate, non-distracting way. The user is able to navigate through the brandspace, obtaining useful information and products along the way.</p>
<p>Through this process, a story unfolds with elements that each have a unique lifespan. This is the basis for a cascade to occur in the brandspace.  The longer the lifespan of an element, the simpler the element should be. For example, the logo of a company should hold it’s structure and relevance over time, while timely, calendar-driven, promotional content can take the form of the latest visual/verbal trends.</p>
<p>Another layer of communication in the brandspace is the aspect of self-identity and reputation management. Woven into each message is a secondary message that always provides the user with an idea of who or what the entity is. Aside from an “about us” page on an entity’s website, the process is frequently subtle and subconscious. An additional element of this layer has to do with objective-based messaging–the element of the message that identifies what the entity is attempting to achieve. An example of this layer could be in the form of a tag line. The most successful jaunt by a user through a entity’s brandspace will involve them being able to intuitively determine who the branded entity is, and what they are doing.</p>
<p>If an entity can be aware of how messages are affected by time and space, they are in a much better position to create consistent messaging without having to re-invent the wheel by producing countless revisions to their brand experience. A well thought-out approach will provide a set of conventions that become scalable as new elements are added, removed and or products combined.</p>
