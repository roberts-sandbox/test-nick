Just having fun with making a 'me' page. the goal is for it to be an app like experience with a horizontal scroll. 
I found some js by Marco Rosella - http://www.centralscrutinizer.it/en/design/js-php/horizontal-tiny-scrolling.

It's really cool, but it looks like there might be an issue with the firefox and IE support... it's scrolling... 
very... slowly... on those browsers...
