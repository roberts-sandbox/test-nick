<h2>Information architecture is not a site map. It's not a mockup. It's the analysis of how users move through the application, web property, ecosystem, whatever. Sound UX design involves defining user profiles, defining user flows, communicating findings with product managers, engineers and visual designers, putting prototypes in front of users, rolling out live data tests. It's an evolving process that guides us toward giving users the stuff they want. This essential part of the process bridges the gap between design and engineering.</h2>
