<h2>I live and breathe user-experience. The projects have been diverse. I’ve worked with fortune 500 companies, conceptualized strategy and branding for major public infrastructure projects, branded a pet hospital and designed my own fonts. I’ve created pixel perfect mock-ups, developed user-interfaces, built e-commerce websites, launched marketing campaigns, launched products, and typeset a series of books.</h2>

<h2>I’ve worked at tech-start ups, creative agencies, design firms, urban planning offices, and ran my own business. Part artist, I love to discuss whitespace, contrast, tension, hierarchy. Part nerd, I’d gladly explain acronyms like MVC, CMYK, XHTML, IRC, VCS, CSMP. I helped plan a major design conference, lectured at universities, and wrote a short story that was published in a literary anthology.</h2>

<h2>Currently, I work at <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com">BitTorrent Inc</a>. as the Brand Experience Lead on the User Experience Team. We’re in the midst of revamping the BitTorrent brand as the company takes the vision to a whole new level. Exciting stuff.</h2>
