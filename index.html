<h2>What is Brand Experience Design? Itâ€™s a combination of UX (User Experience), UI Design (User Interface), and Brand Design. A Brand Experience Designer is like a tailor, skilled at stitching together many different elements. The goal is to provide good design that fits well and feels right. Brand Experience Designers present users/customers with a unified set of relevant elements, so experiences are logical, make sense and are easy to navigate.</h2>
