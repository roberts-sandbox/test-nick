<h2>What is <em>Brand Experience Design</em>? It's a combination of <a href="/ux-samples/">UX</a> (User Experience), <a href="/visual-samples/">UI Design</a> (User Interface), and <a href="/visual-samples/">Brand Design</a>. A Brand Experience Designer is like a tailor, skilled at <a href="https://twitter.com/istitch">stitching together</a> many different elements. The goal is to provide good design that fits well and feels right. Brand Experience Designers present users/customers with a unified set of relevant elements, so experiences are logical, make sense and are easy to navigate.</h2>

<h2>Examples of successful Brand Experience Design can be found in companies such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks">Starbucks</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.">Apple</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype">Skype</a>. I will attempt to define the practice and process of brand experience design here on this site.</h2>
